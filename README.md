Hello world!


This is the first time that I use Github, even though I registered back on the 25th of February 2018.

Afterwards having graduated on Economics and Business Administration in 2018 and 2019, nowadays I am studying a Master in Data Science in the same university: UOC (https://studies.uoc.edu/en/study-at-the-uoc)

I should admit that I am a complety noob on progamming but my attitude compensate my aptitude trying to improve my coding skills day by day focused on JavaScript and Python due to its high scalability of learning and its wide appliances.

My idea about this repo is having a "tailor's drawer" where I will collect pieces of code that I might use on other projects or that the community might share on theirs projects.

Keep in touch!
