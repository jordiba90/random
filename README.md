Hello world!

This is the first time that I use Github, even though I registered back on the 25th of February 2018.

After having graduated on Economics and Business Administration in 2018 and 2019, I am studying nowadays a Master in Data Science in the same university: UOC (https://studies.uoc.edu/en/study-at-the-uoc)

I should admit that I am a complete noob on progamming, but my attitude compensates my aptitude, trying to improve my coding skills day by day focused on JavaScript and Python due to its high scalability of learning and its wide appliances.

My idea about this repo is having a "tailor's drawer" where I will collect pieces of code that I might use on other projects while the community might use them on theirs.

Keep on touch!
